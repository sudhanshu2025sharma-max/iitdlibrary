# What are Variables?

# A computer is essentially a calculator that runs extremely fast. It calculates a number. If it doesn't save that number immediately, the number vanishes. It’s gone.

# To build a program, we need a way to tell the computer: "Calculate this result, give it a name, and hold onto it until I ask for it."
# That is what a Variable is.

# So Variables are nothing just a container having the value which can be reusable many times.

# Values of variables can be reasigned as well as many times.

# Variables are casesensitive
