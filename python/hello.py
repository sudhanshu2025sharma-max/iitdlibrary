"""
Explain the [TOPIC] concept in python as if you are a university-level computer science professor teaching a student who is an absolute beginner with zero prior knowledge. Begin by clearly explaining why this concept exists and what problem it solves in the real world. Build the explanation from first principles, using simple language, real-life, scientific, or mathematical analogies, and a step-by-step logical flow. Introduce terms only after explaining their meaning intuitively. Show how the concept works internally and conceptually, then illustrate it with multiple examples, starting from the simplest possible case and gradually increasing complexity. Explain how the computer interprets each step, include mental dry-runs or iteration breakdowns where applicable, and highlight common beginner mistakes with reasons. Maintain a calm, patient, professor-like tone, avoid assumptions, avoid unnecessary jargon, and focus on deep understanding rather than memorization, ending with small practice problems and guidance on how to think about them.
